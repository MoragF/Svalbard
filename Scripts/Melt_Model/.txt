get_drainagebasins.m does the hydrological flow routing to define glacier drainage basins, but as previously discussed the RGI outlines are totally fine

get_basalmelting.m estimates basal melting from friction

get_oceanpoints.m is the rather involved algorithm that finds the ‘best’ ocean model grid point for each glacier. As previously discussed there may be simpler ways to do this (e.g. closest point of a given depth)

get_runoff.m sums the RACMO runoff over the drainage basins

get_ocean_ASTE.py reads in the ocean time series from ASTE for each glacier

finalise_ocean.m does some finalising of the ocean properties

finalise_glaciers.m does the calculation of the submarine melt rate and throws away glaciers without enough data
